Hi! I am Zoe. Currently a <a href="https://www.fsd.ed.tum.de/staff-members/zoe-mbikayi/"> research associate </a> and doctoral candidate at the <a href="https://www.fsd.ed.tum.de/" target="_blank"> Institute of Flight System Dynamics</a> of the Technical University of Munich - <a href="https://www.ed.tum.de/en/ed/home-1/" target="_blank"> School of Engineering and Design</a>.

I spent most of my early academic years in Russia, studying at Moscow Aviation Institute, and working in its department of <a href="https://k106.mai.ru/" target="_blank"> Flight Dynamics and Control</a> as a lecturer and doing research in the Pilot Vehicle Laboratory, under <a href="https://mai.ru/content/people/index.php?ID=7782" target="_blank">Prof. Alexander Efremov</a> . I also spent some time studying and working at Isae Supaero in Toulouse, France, in the department of <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/research/departments/department-of-aerospace-vehicles-design-and-control-dcas-95/dcas-resources-and-equipment/" target="_blank"> Aerospace Vehicle Design and Control</a>.

Research Interests
------

This is easy. I am interested in flight control in general.

For those who have no idea what it means, well, I make flying things fly. Or more specifically, I make them such that they can be controlled either by a human or automatically. And by flyng things, I mean aircrafts. 

For those saying "flying control" is a little broad, well, I've worked quite a bit in handling qualities, mathematical modeling of the human pilot behavior, and pilot vehicle systems, and mostly inner loop control.

Also, recently I started developing an interest in trajectory generation and trajectory control. It might just become my main area of interest.
