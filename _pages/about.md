Hi! I am Zoe. I am a <a href="https://www.fsd.ed.tum.de/staff-members/zoe-mbikayi/"> research associate </a> and doctoral candidate at the <a href="https://www.fsd.ed.tum.de/" target="_blank"> Institute of Flight System Dynamics</a> of the Technical University of Munich - <a href="https://www.ed.tum.de/en/ed/home-1/" target="_blank"> School of Engineering and Design.</a> My doctorate is under the supervision of <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/holzapfel-florian" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. -Ing Florian Holzapfel</a> of the Technical University of Munich, and <a href="https://uttri.utoronto.ca/people/hugh-h-t-liu/" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Hugh Liu</a> of the University of Toronto.

I spent most of my early academic years in Russia, studying at Moscow Aviation Institute, and working in its department of <a href="https://k106.mai.ru/" target="_blank"> Flight Dynamics and Control</a> as a lecturer and doing research in the Pilot Vehicle Laboratory, under <a href="https://mai.ru/content/people/index.php?ID=7782" target="_blank">Prof. Alexander Efremov.</a> I also spent some time studying and working at Isae Supaero in Toulouse, France, in the department of <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/research/departments/department-of-aerospace-vehicles-design-and-control-dcas-95/dcas-resources-and-equipment/" target="_blank"> Aerospace Vehicle Design and Control.</a>

Research Interests
------

This is easy. I am interested in flight control in general. Check out my <a href="https://zmbikayi.github.io/publications/"> publications.</a> Most of the papers are open access. But if you can't find a paper, shoot me an email and I will be happy to share the PDF.

For those who have no idea what it means, well, I make flying things fly. Or more specifically, I make them such that they can be controlled either by a human or automatically. And by flying things, I mean aircraft, spacecraft, airships, etc... 

For those saying "flight control" is a little broad, well, I've worked quite a bit in handling qualities, mathematical modeling of the human pilot behavior, and pilot vehicle systems, and mostly inner loop control.

And I recently started shifting my interests towards trajectory generation and trajectory control.


Personal Interests
------
  * Playing music (Piano and Guitar)
  * Photography:  You can see some photos<a href="https://zmbikayi.github.io/portfolio"> here</a>
  * Traditional archery
  * Biking
  * Paragliding (Haven't flown in a while though)
  * Messing around with computers and networks, and doing DIY: For example I built myself a closed smart home system (Focus on privacy. No Amazon or google stuff) - Jarvis. From building the home server computer and hardware to control the appliances, to writting the software to control the whole thing and training the AI models. Well, I also used some open source models and pieces of code. 
  
  I have been expanding it and it is becoming a general purpose assisstant, capable of not only manage my apartment, but also having conversations, code (sometimes even write code to improve itself. But only I can do the integration after reviewing the code), etc.. Oh, and, you might have guessed it, I'm also using the ChatGPT API to simulate certain things, and run parts of my conversation engine (And yes. I've looked into the privacy policy of OpenAI, and I believe it is acceptable). 

Just me
