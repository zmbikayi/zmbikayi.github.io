Hi! I am Zoe. I am a <a href="https://www.fsd.ed.tum.de/staff-members/zoe-mbikayi/"> research associate </a> and doctoral candidate at the <a href="https://www.fsd.ed.tum.de/" target="_blank"> Institute of Flight System Dynamics</a> of the Technical University of Munich - <a href="https://www.ed.tum.de/en/ed/home-1/" target="_blank"> School of Engineering and Design.</a> My doctorate is under the supervision of <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/holzapfel-florian" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. -Ing Florian Holzapfel</a> of the Technical University of Munich, and <a href="https://uttri.utoronto.ca/people/hugh-h-t-liu/" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Hugh Liu</a> of the University of Toronto.


I spent most of my early academic years in Russia, studying at Moscow Aviation Institute, and working in its department of <a href="https://k106.mai.ru/" target="_blank"> Flight Dynamics and Control</a> as a lecturer and doing research in the Pilot Vehicle Laboratory, under <a href="https://mai.ru/content/people/index.php?ID=7782" target="_blank">Prof. Alexander Efremov.</a> I also spent some time studying and working at Isae Supaero in Toulouse, France, in the department of <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/research/departments/department-of-aerospace-vehicles-design-and-control-dcas-95/dcas-resources-and-equipment/" target="_blank"> Aerospace Vehicle Design and Control.</a>


Research Interests
------

I am interested in flight control in general. Although in the past I did quite a bit of inner loop control, handling qualities and pilot-vehicle systems, now I am particularly interested in trajectory generation and control. 

Check out my <a href="https://zmbikayi.github.io/publications/"> publications.</a> Most of the papers are open access. But if you can't find a paper, shoot me an email and I will be happy to share the PDF.

For those who have no idea what it means, well, I make flying things fly. By flying things, I mean aircraft, UAVs, airships, etc... 
I am also a professional Scratcher (Not a DJ. More like a Simulink wizard).

Personal Interests
------
  * Playing music: I play the Piano and the Guitar. Trying to learn the violin, the German Zither, and the accordion.

  * Photography: You can see some photos <a href="https://zmbikayi.github.io/portfolio">here</a>.

  * Traditional archery: I have a nice takedown recurve bow with a riser made out of wood. I love it.

  * Mountain biking: Mostly doing XC down the trails.

  * Paragliding (Haven't flown in a while though).

  * Messing around with computers and networks, and doing DIY: For example I built myself a closed smart home system - Jarvis, with a special focus on privacy.
    
    * I am following the same architecture as the human nervous system;
    * I try to build everything from scratch or use open source tools. 
    * Most of Jarvis is written in python.
    * Jarvis is now a general purpose assistant, managing the home, having conversations, etc. It's a bit like Alexa on steroids.

Just me
